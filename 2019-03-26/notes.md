01-array
the initial array was 2 in length and the final length of the array was 8 in lenghth

02-array
In the process.argv there 2 and a 0
when x=2 y=6
in this example the coefficients being in reverse did not change the results.

03-array-concat

IF you console.log(clubs.length); you get a result of 2.  clubs2 and clubs1 can't be equal because clubs1 is adding an array of numbers, not just two numbers to an array.
The push after to concate changes the results. the push, changes the arragements of the array in that the push statement is produced before the .concat. If you place the .push before the .concat then the new array is added inside array for club1 and changes the value of clubs, which also changes the value of clubs2. Clubs2 will then have the result of adding the new array due to the .push.

04-array slice
If you add a console.log(.reverse(index)); then we should be able to change the order of the cards.

To change the order of the cards displayed for cards after the cut to the cards before the cut, change the placement of the console.log for the cut cards. You can log the cards that were cut.
Update: create another const to display the cards that were cut before the cards that weren't cut.
