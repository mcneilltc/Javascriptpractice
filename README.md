01-string
On the html file, <label>string:</label> is what we see along with the <input type=”text”>
/> means the end of the input tag
the const stringEmpty is has space tagged between the parenthesis, that space is its value. When that is console.log, of that variable, then the space is logged and present as an empty space. The string isn’t really empty. When you console.log the using ‘typeof’ it presents that the variable is a string. This happens for both cases of the empty and nonempty variables. The const stringnonempty is given the value of ‘non-empty’ and when you console.log the variable it will provide you the value.
