01-string
On the html file, <label>string:</label> is what we see along with the <input type=”text”>
/> means the end of the input tag
the const stringEmpty is has space tagged between the parenthesis, that space is its value. When that is console.log, of that variable, then the space is logged and present as an empty space. The string isn’t really empty. When you console.log the using ‘typeof’ it presents that the variable is a string. This happens for both cases of the empty and nonempty variables. The const stringnonempty is given the value of ‘non-empty’ and when you console.log the variable it will provide you the value.

02-numbers
The difference b/w 01-string and 02-numbers is that the 02-numbers is outputting numbers but the types of the properties have changed. In the string they are identified as strings and with the numbers they are identified as numbers. The numbers are also being used for calculations of their identifiable variable. The string, if numbers were added would print the number but it would be printed as a string due to the use of ' '.

The input type number does calculations and therefore limits its inputs to just number otherwise the return will be NaN. With the JS and the html number files, the html output only allowed for the selection of numbers whereas the input of text allowed for the input of both letters and numbers. The numbers in that case would be taken in as strings and not calculatable numbers. JS seems to complete the calculation and display the results without displaying the calculation process.

03-boolean

In the last two console.log statments the ! means opposite of the statement. Therefore when it prints the statement its opposite value. In the case of the boolean the opposite of true is false and vice versa. 

Add the attribute checked to the input element.
The title element contained in the head element adds a title to the tab of the webpage upon loading.

04-prompt

add another prompt to be able to get the option to add another value. Or refresh the webpage to restart the prompt process
prompt(temperatureF);
you can add another constant and define it within the same parameters to output.
